# LevelsCountDownPython
PythonProject

# What the project is about.
- we are in the inventory shop.
- there are people appointed to physically check the stock levels
- and people make mistakes and as a result, during stock taking, you find two people are appointed to count same stock twice.
- we creating a system, that will check the stock levels

# How it will work
- as an item is purchased, it is written off in the stock levels
- we will have various levels, that will be on different colours
- colour red will represent danger, that is an alert to stock now now. this is the stage where we asking when items are getting delivered.
- yellow will represent a time to place the order again.
- green is the safe zone. that is stock levels are okay.

# What inspires this project?
- i worked at this company. one saturday of the month, we would do stocktaking. it was draining
- so i figured that an automated system is required and must be in place.

# How will be the execution
- i will use the notepad, that is listing all items in the shop.
- there will be 5 items each.
- so every time an item is bought, it gets subtracted. when it reaches certain colour, it issues a notification
- and when the item is added, it will recount the whole line and change the colour as well.
